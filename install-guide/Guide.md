6. Once the download is done you're folder should look something like this, if it didn't you didnt read the step above correctly it might look different, if so you have a **HMW-mod_1.4.0** folder its content should contain `hmw-mod`, `hmw-usermaps`, and a few other files, copy all of those up a folder  
7. After you are done downloading, start the launcher and click verify, if you did everything correctly you should have mod 1.4.0 installed succesfully, and the verification should pass.
